# UI Color Palette
UI Color Palette is a Sketch plugin that creates consistent and accessible color palettes specifically for UI. The plugin uses alternative color spaces, like `LCH`, `OKLCH`, `CIELAB`, `OKLAB`, and `HSLuv`, to create color shades based on the configured lightness scale. These spaces ensure [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) compliance and sufficient contrast between information and background color.

The idea to make this Sketch plugin comes from the article: [Accessible Palette: stop using HSL for color systems](https://wildbit.com/blog/accessible-palette-stop-using-hsl-for-color-systems).

This plugin will allow you to:
- Create a complete palette from any existing color to help you build a color scaling (or Primitive colors).
- Manage the color palette in real-time to control the contrast.
- Sync the color shades with local styles, variables, and third-party plugins.
- Generate code in various languages.
- Publish the palette for reuse across multiple documents or add shared palettes from the community.

### Debugging

To view the output of your `console.log`, you have a few different options:

- Open `Console.app` and look for the sketch logs
- Look at the `~/Library/Logs/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugin Output.log` file

Skpm provides a convenient way to do the latter:

```bash
skpm log
```

The `-f` option causes `skpm log` to not stop when the end of logs is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input
